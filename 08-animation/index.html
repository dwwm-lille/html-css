                It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
                have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's

                starship, custodian of the stolen plan that can save her people and restore
                freedom to the galaxy...
